    <!--About me paragraph-->
    <p>Back in 2019, I had the brilliant idea to make a workout assistant mobile application, but had no idea how to even start. 
        So I looked up how to make mobile apps, and thus began my journey into coding! Skip ahead to now, and I have a number of computer science courses under
        my belt, a few projects to showcase, and awaiting the opportunity to step into the tech and contribute to projects that have impact on the world.
